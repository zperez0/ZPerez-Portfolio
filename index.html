    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>After graduating from culinary school and working in the industry as a cook for three years, I decided to uproot my life in Florida to move to the west coast. Here I found a love for working with plants. Over five years, I worked for numerous farms and nurseries. I am currently pursuing a newfound passion as a full-stack developer by attending Epicodus.</p>

    <h3>Projects:</h3>

      <li>Favorite band website</li>
      <p>My partner and I created a webpage for a band called Vampire Weekend. There you will find a photo, a short bio and a side bar containing upcoming shows. Languages include HTML and CSS</p>

      <li>Cupcake Shop</li>
      <p>Created a fictitious cupcake shop webpage called Dragonstone Cupcakes. There you will find names, photos and descriptions of each cupcake. Languages include HTML and CSS.</p>
